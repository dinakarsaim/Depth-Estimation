# Depth-Estimation

Comparision of a dl encoder-decoder model with various attention mechanisms in depth estimation tasks.

The attention mechanisms used are
1) Channel Attention
2) Spatial Attention
3) CBAM

Also the more-better-cbam.ipynb has a new loss function which is a combination of l1+ssim loss and shows better results compared to others.
